## Hi, I'm Shreya!
I am an engineer with diverse interests. I love to share my knowledge and experience through articles and/or presentations. I organise events for open source communities and speak at them too. In the past, I've spoken about Generative AI, Embedded Engineering and the importance of open source software.

Throughout my professional journey, I have worked in diverse roles such as software engineering, developer relations engineering and content creation. All of this has equipped me with a broad understanding of diverse software tools (Python, JavaScript, SQL, Golang, LLMs), multicultural teams, and getting things done!

As of late I have been exploring linguistics, and I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alt-shreya) if you're into that sort of thing.
